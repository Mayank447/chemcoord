Thank you for your interest in the python module ChemCoord.


If you want to read the documentation, you can get either a html version or a pdf.

For the html version, please go to docs/ and execute (without the dollar sign):
$ make html
Afterwards you can open the index.html file in docs/build/html with any browser.

For the pdf version, please go to docs/ and execute (again without the dollar sing):
$ make latex
$ make latexpdf
Afterwards you can open ChemCoord.pdf in docs/build/latex with any pdf reader.
