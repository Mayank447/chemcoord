## Introduction

With this module you can read cartesian (xyz) and internal (zmat) coordinates into pandas DataFrames.
Besides it supplies you with a lot of functions to manipulate them and make your workflow more efficient.



## Documentation
The official documentation is hosted on PyData.org: http://pandas.pydata.org/

The Sphinx documentation should provide a good starting point for learning how
to use the library. Expect the docs to continue to expand as time goes on.


If you want to read the documentation, you can get either a html version or a pdf.

For the html version, please go to docs/ and execute (without the dollar sign):
$ make html
Afterwards you can open the index.html file in docs/build/html with any browser.

For the pdf version, please go to docs/ and execute (again without the dollar sing):
$ make latex
$ make latexpdf
Afterwards you can open ChemCoord.pdf in docs/build/latex with any pdf reader.
