metadata
=======================================

This is a (by default empty) dictionary, that can be filled with arbitrary
``key : value`` pairs by the user.
It is unused and unchanged by all methods, but is guaranteed to be
passed on when doing operations that return a new Cartesian instance.

This allows the user to keep information of interested connected with the
corresponding coordinates.
