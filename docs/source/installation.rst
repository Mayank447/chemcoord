Installation guide
==================
A working python installation is required (2.7 and >=3.5 are possible).

It is highly recommended to use this module in combination with
  [Ipython](http://ipython.org/) and [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).
They come shipped by default with the
  [anaconda3 installer](https://www.continuum.io/downloads/)

Unix
++++


For the packaged versions, the following commands have to be executed in the
  terminal:
```
conda install chemcoord
```
or
```
pip install chemcoord
```
For the up to date development version (experimental):
```
git clone https://github.com/mcocdawc/chemcoord.git
cd chemcoord
pip install .
```

Windows
+++++++

Neither installation nor running the module are tested on windows.
To the best of my knowledge it should work there as well.
Just use the same steps as for UNIX.
