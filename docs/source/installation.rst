Installation Guide
==================

You need a working python 3.x installation together with some standard modules.
You can use for example the `anaconda3 installer <https://www.continuum.io/downloads/>`_.

The advantage of the anaconda3 installer is that you get a lot of additional modules and programs,
that make it really easy to work with python. 
For example `Ipython <http://ipython.org/>`_ and the `jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`_.
I highly recommend to use those.

Unix
++++

Just type in your terminal::

    pip install chemcoord

Windows
+++++++

I tested neither installation nor running the module on windows.
As far as I know it should work as well if you use the ``pip`` manager.
If you get it installed and running, please report it on the Github page.
